Welcome to Donny Mbaga's personal website, I've decided I want 
this shit for these: 

  - The goal of my personal website

  - To showcase what I'll be working on mostly

  - For pinning down my thoughts

  - For branding Donny Mbaga, as a software Developer

  - A piece of memory when I'm gone


When in home page, hovering on navbar items on the left, they turn white instead
of the other color, I don't want that.
